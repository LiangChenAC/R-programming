Answer: character

Question 6
If I have two vectors x <- c(1,3, 5) and y <- c(3, 2, 10), what is produced by the expression cbind(x, y)?

Answer: a numeric matrix with 3 rows and 2 columns

Question 7
A key property of vectors in R is that

Answer: elements of a vector all must be of the same class

Question 8
Suppose I have a list defined as x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE). What does x[[1]] give me?

Answer: a list containing the number 2.

Question 9
Suppose I have a vector x <- 1:4 and a vector y <- 2. What is produced by the expression x + y?

Answer: a numeric vector with elements 3, 4, 5, 6. 

Question 10
Suppose I have a vector x <- c(17, 14, 4, 5, 13, 12, 10) and I want to set all elements of this vector that are greater than 10 to be equal to 4. What R code achieves this?

Answer: x[x >= 11] <- 4
